# Welcome to Ludique's GitHub organization !

We thrive to make fun experiences for everyone.

## Current projects

### Nimbus

Nimbus is a Minecraft Java Edition PaperMC server. Our goal is to create a more thrilling experience with RPG aspects and seasonal content for experienced players. Stay tuned for updates!

### Ludique.js

Ludique.js is a JavaScript Library for 2D browser-based games that has been on my mind for quite a while now. Some details regarding implementation and exact technologies used are still to be determined, but after creating my [first JS 2D game](https://noosas-world.netlify.app), I am determined to make something out of it. Note that the demo game was made before concieving the library and features might be buggy and not representative of what you would see in a Ludique.js game.

## About Ludique

Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is [RaphaÃ«l Pion](https://github.com/raphpion) and I'm a Web Developper, videogames enjoyer and musician from QuÃ©bec, Canada. I am currently studying for a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Sherbrooke's University and am really passionate about all things tech-related.

Ludique is a long-term project based on the idea of gamifying the Web and which evolved into the general objective of making fun experiences for everyone. Ludique will definitely grow as I strive to become a better developper and acquire field experience.
